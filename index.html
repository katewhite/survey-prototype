      <h3>Recently Updated</h3>
      <p>The following updates have been made in this version (published September 29, 2013):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>8-29-13: Created Site</li>
        <li>9-29-13: Added first versions of Survey List screen and Controller List screen.  This version contains 2 tab bar versions, 3 nav bar versions, and 4 survey list versions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Things to Note</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>9-29-13: 
        	<ul> 
        		<li> PAGES heading is where full screens can be viewed.  Each screen contains smaller components.  Those components can be viewed and changed on the full screen, while viewing the page.</li>
        		<li>To get more information and notes about each component, view them from the COMPONENTS view.</li><li>When viewing the full page, the right arrow for flipping through components has a bug.  Use the left arrow to view the variations</li>
        		<li>There are a number of bugs and odd things that exist in this prototyping tool.  I plan on fixing bugs and improving it as we go along.  Definitely point things out as you see them concerning the tool itself, and I can make improvements.  First things on my list are fixing the forward arrow bug when flipping through components, and improving the components detail pages.  The notes are in an odd place and clicking the versions in the list on the right does not do anything right now.  It would be great if it scrolled right to the component, and if the notes for the component displayed directly above the component itself, rather than just at the top of the entire page.</li>
