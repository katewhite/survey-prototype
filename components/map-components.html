  	<li>map options overall - The map is definitely proving to be the most difficult for me to come up with something I truly love.  Obviously there are some map pins present on the map itself, but not much else.  I created the pins for controllers.  I like the roundness of them, and they certainly stand out on the map.  I had another version of the pin that had the controller icon (clock) in the middle instead of the number.  If controllers really will just have numbers and not unique names, then I think the numbers make sense.  I obviously still need to work on zones, etc.  The main focus here is the overlays, although I think they are still far from ideal as well.  I'm hoping that with a few iterations here on design, we can get somewhere that's kind of close to what we have in mind, but think we should follow that up fairly quickly with some working prototypes.  I think the zooming functionality, real zone coordinates, etc. are going to be key in making final decisions around the map design and interactions.</li>
  	<li>v1 - Fairly basic.  Relatively close to what appeared in the majority of the flow prototypes and sketches.  No edit button here.</li>
  	<li>ControllerSelected - This demonstrates what selecting a comtroller would appear like.  All items that belong to that controller are then in their active states as well.  Zones are filled in, and other asset marker's outlines are filled in.</li>
    <li>BackflowSelected - This demonstrates what selecting a "lower-level" valve would appear like.  Only the valve itself is in the active state because it has no children.</li>
    <li>ControllerSelected - v2 - This adds the black outline to the zones as well.</li>
    <li>BackflowSelected - v2 - This adds white outline to the parent.</li>
    <li>ControllerSelected - v3 - This removes the black outline from all components and utilizes increased opacity and larger circle area to indicate "active" instead.</li>
  </ul>
