  	<li>map options overall - The map is definitely proving to be the most difficult for me to come up with something I truly love.  Obviously there are some map pins present on the map itself, but not much else.  I created the pins for controllers.  I like the roundness of them, and they certainly stand out on the map.  I had another version of the pin that had the controller icon (clock) in the middle instead of the number.  If controllers really will just have numbers and not unique names, then I think the numbers make sense.  I obviously still need to work on zones, etc.  The main focus here is the overlays, although I think they are still far from ideal as well.  I'm hoping that with a few iterations here on design, we can get somewhere that's kind of close to what we have in mind, but think we should follow that up fairly quickly with some working prototypes.  I think the zooming functionality, real zone coordinates, etc. are going to be key in making final decisions around the map design and interactions.</li>
  	<li>v1 - Fairly basic.  Relatively close to what appeared in the majority of the flow prototypes and sketches.  No edit button here.</li>
  	<li>v2 - An option for actions.  This allows for the user to edit the Controller location, or zone region outline.  Also considered this option because I was afraid v1 when paired with the nav bar, looked a little icon-heavy on the right side of the screen.</li>
